<h2 style="font-size:2rem" class="space" id="about">Who is Tom Nook?</h2>
<p class="body-paragraph">
Tom Nook is a raccoon, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog">tanuki</a>, who runs various businesses in the Nintendo game, <i>Animal Crossing</i>. His English name is derived from "tanuki" (often written as "Tanooki" in English) and his last name is likely a pun based on a myth about the Tanuki. His Japanese name, Tanukichi, is a mix between Tanuki and the Japanese word, "kechi", meaning stingy.

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In the past, Tom Nook was an ambitious, money-driven individual who dreamed of fame and glory, even abandoning his friends to pursue such dreams in the city, although he still thought of his friends, particularly Sable, and would frequently exchange letters with them. After barely making a living and no profits, Tom returned to his home a more contemporary, down-to-earth individual, being described by Sable as a "completely different soul." Tom also says things such as "yes yes" or "hm" in his speech.</p>
A short description of Tom Nook, <blockquote style=color:#003399>"A kind raccoon with a heart of gold, Tom Nook helps you get started when you first move to town by loaning you a home to live in. Tom also runs a little supply shop in town that sells all the basics, including furniture, tools, and gardening supplies. Tom will help you in a variety of ways as your life unfolds, and you'll help him as well: keep shopping at the store and it'll get bigger and bigger. Eventually, old Tom will even need to hire his two nephews, Timmy and Tommy, just to keep his business running!"</blockquote> — <i>Animal Crossing: City Folk</i>

<h2>Physical Apperance</h2>
Tom Nook is a brown racoon dog with a sharp snout with hooded eyelids and purple pupils. Throughout the different games, he is seen in a variety of different outfits. While he does have various styles, he does appear in signature outfits throughout the series:
<h2 style="font-weight:700; font-size:1rem">2001 to 2008:</h2>

<figcaption class="caption">Tom Nook's outfit in the games <i>Animal Forest</i> (2001), <i>Animal Crossing</i> (2001), <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i> (2005), and <i>Animal Crossing: City Folk</i> (2008). He is seen wearing a blue apron with the Animal Crossing leaf logo graphic. In <i>Animal Forest</i>, it is the kanji 店 (ten), meaning "shop". The blue apron is inferred to be for modesty, referencing the legends of tanuki.</figcaption><br>

He is seen in a white button up shirt, a red necktie, layered underneath a green argayle print sweater vest and grey trousers.</figcaption>

<figcaption class="caption">Tom Nook's outfit in the most recent game release, <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i> (2020). He is seen in a white short sleeved button up top with a teal leaf pattern and khakis.</figcaption>
<br>
From <i>Animal Forest through City Folk</i>, as the town's shop owner, he will wear different uniforms for each upgrade of his store.
<ul>
  <li>For <i>Nook 'N' Go</i>, he wears blue, orange, and white-striped shirt and pillbox hat (in Animal Forest, this uniform was red, green, and white).</li>
  <li>For <i>Nookway</i>, he wears a white apron with a purple leaf and green details on it (blue and orange in <i>Animal Forest</i>).</li>
  <li>For <i>Nookington's</i>, he wears a bright blue suit jacket and pink tie.</li>
  <li>For the lottery, he wears a red, white and blue apron and sports visor. <i>In Animal Forest</i>, this was a red and black haori in addition to his usual apron, and a white hachimaki tied around his head.</li>
</ul><br>

<h3 style="font-size:2rem" id="what-does-he-do">What Does He Do?</h3>
</p style=text-align: right>Tom Nook's store is the economic centerpiece of every player's town (with the exception of Re-Tail in New Leaf). The store is owned and operated by Tom Nook, the most important non-playable character in the series.</p><br>
<img src="https://ppuglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tom-Nook-603x900.png" style="float:left" alt="Tom Nook holding bag of Bells" width=20% height=30%><br>
<br><h3>Animal Crossing</h3>
<p> In Animal Crossing, Tom Nook runs a lottery on the last day of every month where spotlight items and NES games can be won if the player has raffle tickets. There are also random sales on occasion, as well as a selection of grab bags on Sale Day. Tom Nook is also responsible for all players' mortgages, and will erect a statue outside the Train Station for each player who makes full repayments to him by depositing money in the Post Office. This is the only game where the player can give passwords to Tom Nook. This allows for the transfer of items between towns.</p>
<h3>Wild World</h3>
<p>Tom Nook returns in <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i> as the shop owner once again. In this game, his store is now always adjacent to the Able Sisters, and the lottery, password and Sale Day features are removed. He also no longer sells clothes or umbrellas. However, the Tom Nook Point System is introduced to allow for eventual discounts on all purchases, with occasional Point Special days awarding five times the points, and Spotlight Items will infrequently appear in store. Nookington's contains Shampoodle on the lower floor, and upgrading to this store triggers Tom Nook's episodes. Each player now shares Tom Nook's mortgage, and Tom will still force new players to work for him even when it is fully paid off. He states that he will 'not charge' the player for the lessons they are learning in Animal Crossing life. His picture can be obtained by giving him a Safe, and the quote is "I'll be there with bells on! Ho ho!"</p>
<h3>City Folk</h3>
<p>Tom Nook acts similarly to <i>Animal Crossing: Wild World</i>. His store is never directly to the west of the Able Sisters. Players each have their own mortgage once again. Tom Nook will erect a flag outside a house with its mortgage fully paid off. After a period of time with Nookington's in City Folk, Tom Nook will ask the player a question to "better serve his customers." Based on the answer given, Nookington's can close and reopen one of the previous stores, excluding Nook's Cranny. Periodically, after the first questioning, Tom Nook will ask again, and the player can once more change the store.</p>
<h3>New Leaf</h3>
Nook runs a real estate store in place of a shop, and players are no longer required to work for him. The player, the new mayor, moves in without a home, but Tom Nook assists the player by letting the player determine the location of their new home. Construction of the home, however, takes a day and a 10,000 Bells down payment from the player, so they must sleep in a tent. Once the home is built, players must pay off the debt before they can make any expansions. After this, Tom Nook offers exterior home decorations and encourages the player to sign up for the Happy Home Academy, an association that scores players' homes.
<h3>Happy Home Designer</h3>
Tom Nook runs Nook's Homes, he also appears as a client, and he helps run the monthly Happy Home Network Design Contest. During the contest, the player will be asked to design a home for Tom Nook, under the alias King Nook. Under this alias his appearance is notably different, wearing royal clothing including a crown.
<h3>New Horizons</h3>
Nook and the Nooklings are heading a new venture, offering getaway packages to the player that set them up as new residents on a deserted island. Nook is now the founder and CEO of <i>Nook Inc.</i>, a real estate development company. In the game, Nook provides the player with a loan to establish themselves on the island and also runs a Resident Services center that provides a crafting bench and other amenities to the island's residents, like the use of the Nook Stop and recycling bin. When the player progresses through the game and the Resident Services center is upgraded, Nook will provide construction consultation and home upgrades to the player.
<h3>From Rags to Riches: Nook Inc.</h3>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/halwfrpsw7i41.png" alt="Tom Nook Stonks Meme" style="float:right" width=35% height=auto><br>
At the beginning of the game, Tom Nook owns a small wooden shack. As mentioned above, he is now the CEO of his own company Nook Inc. Generally, in the game, as the player buys items from him, the store will expand, eventually into a two-story supermarket. There are a total of four expansions:
<ul>From the original Nook's Cranny store,
  <li>Nook 'n' Go</li>
  <li>Nookway</li>
  <li>Nookington's</li>
  <li>Nook's Homes</li>
</ul>
